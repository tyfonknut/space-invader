## Why has this been made?

This has been my attempt at making a space-invader program in drRacket with Beginning Student Language.
It's made with a beginner file, with template and design "manual" from the "Systematic Design Program" course.

## Will I refactor this mess

Yes (No), this is only temporary (permanent).

## What I've learned?

With preparing test with expected outcomes and following the design recipes, did I find out the following.
By making templates and signatures, so did I end up taking a lot of guesswork out of it.
Taking away needed work helped to lessen the amount of thinking.
It helped separated problems into section or bite sizes that was easier to work with.
