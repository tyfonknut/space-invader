## Why has this been made?

This has been my attempt at making a space-invader program in drRacket with Beginning Student Language.
It's made with a beginner file, with template and design "manual" from the "Systematic Design Program" course.

## Will I refactor this mess

Yes (No), this is only temporary (permanent).

## What I've learned?

By planning, preparing test with expected outcomes, following the design recipes, so did I find out a few things.
Making templates, signatures and other things helped in writing code and taking a lot of guesswork out of it.
Taking away nedded work helped to separate problems into section or bite sizes that was easy to work with.
